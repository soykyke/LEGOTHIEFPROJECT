Lego Thief Game Project
================

# Story

You are a thief and break into a bank. After you made your way into the bank, you use your thief robot to steal the diamond. Using your computer application you try to navigate it to the safe (you can see the view from a camera mounted on the robot). There are watch dog robots patrolling the bank. In the beginning they are not very alert and patrol only slowly. In the bank there are several obstacles, like a tunnel and a ridge you have to overcome to find the safe.

Once the robot finds the safe, you need to solve a puzzle to open it. When the safe opens, the robot needs to drive into it and take the diamond. Now the watch dogs are alert, drive faster and see the thief earlier. Also additional security measures, like a moving axe at the exit are now active.

The robot needs to find the exit and get through the moving axe without being caught by the watch dogs or hit by the axe. If a watch dogs hits the robot, it loses some if its "health". If the dogs hit it too often, it dies.
